The number of indirect beneficiaries is about 4 hundred 
thousand, including residents of Ganja, Barda and surrounding rayons, covered by TV- and Radio-based awareness-raising activities.       

 the direct beneficiaries -   *62 families, or approximately 240 people, out of which 135 females and 105 male. The number of youth aged 15-24 y.o. is 42.                                              *Over 425 schoolchildren, out of which 261 are girls and 164 are boys.

The number of direct beneficiaries, who benefited from the implementation of energy efficiency measures in both facilities with improved living, studying and working conditions, reached 1,800. The reduced energy consumption resulting from using centralized heating systems has led to lower funding requirements by 30 percent. In previous times, families would allocate approximately 50-100 AZN per month for household expenses. However, with the implementation of the centralized heating system, this financial burden has significantly diminished to a mere 15-20 AZN. Furthermore, the project's integration of 20 solar panels boasting an impressive capacity of 10 kWt for outdoor lighting has played a pivotal role in curtailing overall energy consumption.

The indirect beneficiaries - *A training session was held for about 100 high-school students and 20 teachers at a selected secondary school in Barda in order to raise awareness among teachers and schoolchildren about the significance of energy efficiency.  

*To reach a wider audience, two training sessions were organized for the citizens of Ganja, which is home to about 400,000 people. These sessions were held on television and radio platforms to deliver impactful presentations on energy-efficiency principles and conducted enlightening interviews aimed at raising awareness

Improved electricity access in the interior of Suriname
Reduced GHG emissions
",,1.1,"Two renewable hybrid mini grids with each a capacity of 250 kWp  
Four hybrid mini grids capacity of 150 kWp, and four solar shops 

The Implementation Component consist of 6 mini grids, 2 rural productivity zones and 4 solar shops providing electricity to an estimated 6000-8000 people (see breakdown below)

The costs associated with the Implementation Component, are based on a study conducted by the Innovation Energie Développement, where the cost for solar hybrid mini grids (solar PV plus diesel back-up) are estimated in the range of US$5,000-10,000 per kWp installed capacity (IED, 2013). These estimated costs include equipment, connections, engineering costs and supervision (excluding costs for capacity-building). Installation costs of a solar PV system for one RPZ is estimated at around US$180,000 and the total cost of setting up one solar shop is around US$7,000 (NAMA Namibia, 2015).

The RPZ will be supported by rural women organizations. In the NAMA area, rural women are the backbone of sustainable community livelihoods. They are the ones providing food for their families and their communities while also taking care of children and their houses.

I have taken the liberty of making a small estimate.
A household can consume around 1 to 2 kg of charcoal and/or 5 kg of wood per day. Assuming that half of the planned cooking stoves are wood-burning and the other half charcoal-burning, and assuming an energy efficiency of 50 percent, we get this result. The amount of fuel avoided is 3250 g per day, including 750 g of charcoal.

(Ardhi's estimate)
Average charcoal's calorific value 30 MJ/kg
Average wood's CV = 18.5/kg

Need to add Project Description: The UNDP-GEF project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy management, reducing energy consumption and introducing renewable energy (solar PV) in the buildings sector in Turkmenistan. The project will strengthen incentives and capacity to build Nearly-Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) and develop the capacity of three Ministries involved (and other stakeholders) to identify NZE options in the multi-family and public building stock, implement NZEB investments, improve highly-efficient design measures to institutes as well as major housing designers and developers, and replicate these measures through protocols (e.g. update building codes to encompass NZE features) and through mainstreaming NZEB into state construction and housing policies and programs.

The project will result in a direct lifetime emission reduction of 86.91 ktCO2 and indirect emission reduction of 760.51 ktCO2, increased installed RE capacity of 2.1 MW and energy savings of 438,947 MWh (1,580 TJ) over 20 years of the pilot building and other NZE investments.",GEF,0.43,VF,,,,,,6692-1,TKM,,Turkmenistan,795,Asia,Central Asia,,yes,,Asia-Pacific Group,RBEC,Upper middle income,,,LLDC,High,0,0,Other,Capacity Building Training

- IOMT has moved to ITM (Information & Technology
Management)
- ITM has launched the recruitment process of a Vendor
for the implementation of this activity. Subsequently, the
service provider APTECH Africa was selected and
contracted to carry out this activity.
- A meeting was held between UNDP, the Vendor and
the ITM team to establish contact between the country
office and the Vendor.
- Two weeks after their contractualization, a site visit to
the UNDP office was organized. At the end of this visit,
the Vendor should send the report and comments to the
ITM team for further action.
- Currently, the ITM team and the contractor are
finalizing the last technical adjustments, and the ITM
team is waiting for the vendor to provide them the
planning table of their activities; the procedures to be
followed for the implementation of the project; to

Energy service companies will provide energy services such as intallation, maintenance for a period of 7 years before handing over ownership to the Ministry of Health. 

Fossil fuel-based energy production will be replaced with renewable, clean energy solutions that can meet increasing energy demand. Investments will target three types of projects. 
 
(1) Off-grid renewable electricity energy in the form of solar home systems will be provided via an affordable payment plan. 
(2) Green mini-grid projects will also be supported via companies that install, operate and maintain photovoltaic based mini-grids to sell energy services in rural communities. 
(3) Industrial renewable electrical energy and selected on-grid installations will be targeted, by investing in companies that provide modular, transportable, and often rented photovoltaic farms, offering SMEs and communities competitively-priced solar power. 
A public-private partnership instrument will leverage at least two-fold the impact of public capital through private investment.

Climate-friendly Investment Opportunities
- Build capacities to design climate-friendly investment opportunities, address investor risks and blend and catalyze climate finance through an Investment and Financial Flows (I&FF) Assessment in the transport sector

As the energy sector is the main driver under Thailand’s NDC, the NDC support project has helped address the financial barriers to private investment in energy efficiency by initiating the study to design an Energy Efficiency (EE) Platform to support the implementation of innovative private finance mechanisms for leveraging private investment in the energy efficiency sector. Given the potential investment opportunities that the EE Platform are expected to bring, the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) submitted the FY2024 budget request to develop the prototype of Module A: Digitalized Measurement Reporting and Verification (MRV) of approximately 6.2 million Thai baht in which 4.8 million Thai baht was approved by the Budget Bureau.",,,Non-VF,,Accelerating just energy transition,Renewable Energy,,,107518.0-1,THA,,Thailand,764,Asia,South-eastern Asia,,yes,,Asia-Pacific Group,RBAP,Upper middle income,,,,Very High,0,0,Energy Transition,Policy or Regulatory Framework
