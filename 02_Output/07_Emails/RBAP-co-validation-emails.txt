Dear Afghanistan colleagues,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to follow up on our request for your assistance in finalizing the data validation for the Energy Moonshot Tracker effort. We kindly invite you to directly update the Energy Moonshot Tracker Dashboard (hyperlink), as it is currently in an editable mode specifically for this review process.

You can also refer to our video guide (link) or the written guide (link), or alternatively, you may update the original Afghanistan project data sheet https://undp.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/UNDPSustainableEnergyHub/Shared%20Documents/General/0.%20CURRENT%20FOLDER%20-%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Hub/05.%20Accounting%20for%20Progress%20to%20500M/7.%20CO%20Validation/Afghanistan%20-%20Energy%20Projects.xlsx?d=w4c244166660c4e1185f71c6933d18bc8&csf=1&web=1&e=MLxd8y.

As part of this validation process, it is crucial to distinguish between projects that have been already approved and those still in the approval stages. This distinction will enable us to display data only from approved/active/undergoing projects. Therefore, we would appreciate clarification if any projects were solely in the approval stage.

It is also essential to link each project directly to the corresponding Prodocs. With this regard, we have noticed that Prodocs are missing for projects88841 and 132059 and 138844 and 143651 and 147445 and 1000372. Could you kindly share these Prodocs with us at your earliest convenience?

Thank you kindly for your invaluable support in this effort. Please kindly respond to this request by Friday of this week, May 3rd.

Dear Samoa colleagues,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to follow up on our request for your assistance in finalizing the data validation for the Energy Moonshot Tracker effort. We kindly invite you to directly update the Energy Moonshot Tracker Dashboard (hyperlink), as it is currently in an editable mode specifically for this review process.

You can also refer to our video guide (link) or the written guide (link), or alternatively, you may update the original Samoa project data sheet https://undp.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/UNDPSustainableEnergyHub/Shared%20Documents/General/0.%20CURRENT%20FOLDER%20-%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Hub/05.%20Accounting%20for%20Progress%20to%20500M/7.%20CO%20Validation/Samoa%20-%20Energy%20Projects.xlsx?d=wf51243df9c71424cbc3bba828707500e&csf=1&web=1&e=xZzYWS.

As part of this validation process, it is crucial to distinguish between projects that have been already approved and those still in the approval stages. This distinction will enable us to display data only from approved/active/undergoing projects. Therefore, we would appreciate clarification if any projects were solely in the approval stage.

It is also essential to link each project directly to the corresponding Prodocs. With this regard, we have noticed that Prodocs are missing for projects1000418. Could you kindly share these Prodocs with us at your earliest convenience?

Thank you kindly for your invaluable support in this effort. Please kindly respond to this request by Friday of this week, May 3rd.

Best Regards,
Stefano
