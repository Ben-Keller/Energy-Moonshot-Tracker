Dear Argentina colleagues,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to follow up on our request for your assistance in finalizing the data validation for the Energy Moonshot Tracker effort. We kindly invite you to directly update the Energy Moonshot Tracker Dashboard (hyperlink), as it is currently in an editable mode specifically for this review process.

You can also refer to our video guide (link) or the written guide (link), or alternatively, you may update the original Argentina project data sheet https://undp.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/UNDPSustainableEnergyHub/Shared%20Documents/General/0.%20CURRENT%20FOLDER%20-%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Hub/05.%20Accounting%20for%20Progress%20to%20500M/7.%20CO%20Validation/Argentina%20-%20Energy%20Projects.xlsx?d=wb57f63a31e284f8f9ac2c06ab443f85e&csf=1&web=1&e=WRXoyq.

As part of this validation process, it is crucial to distinguish between projects that have been already approved and those still in the approval stages. This distinction will enable us to display data only from approved/active/undergoing projects. Therefore, we would appreciate clarification if any projects were solely in the approval stage.

Thank you kindly for your invaluable support in this effort. Please kindly respond to this request by Friday of this week, May 3rd.

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to follow up on our request for your assistance in finalizing the data validation for the Energy Moonshot Tracker effort. We kindly invite you to directly update the Energy Moonshot Tracker Dashboard (hyperlink), as it is currently in an editable mode specifically for this review process.

You can also refer to our video guide (link) or the written guide (link), or alternatively, you may update the original Suriname project data sheet https://undp.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/UNDPSustainableEnergyHub/Shared%20Documents/General/0.%20CURRENT%20FOLDER%20-%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Hub/05.%20Accounting%20for%20Progress%20to%20500M/7.%20CO%20Validation/Suriname%20-%20Energy%20Projects.xlsx?d=w174b1ec1819c459d8241f331201b56bd&csf=1&web=1&e=uSnEAa.

As part of this validation process, it is crucial to distinguish between projects that have been already approved and those still in the approval stages. This distinction will enable us to display data only from approved/active/undergoing projects. Therefore, we would appreciate clarification if any projects were solely in the approval stage.

Thank you kindly for your invaluable support in this effort. Please kindly respond to this request by Friday of this week, May 3rd.

Best Regards,
Stefano

It is also essential to link each project directly to the corresponding Prodocs. With this regard, we have noticed that Prodocs are missing for projectsTRI/SGP/OP7/YI/CORE/CC/22/09. Could you kindly share these Prodocs with us at your earliest convenience?
